## Overview
Trigonometri Converter is a versatile software designed to handle trigonometric equations, allowing users to convert them into trigonometric graphs and tables of common angles.

## Features
1. **Equation Conversion:** Convert trigonometric equations **(e.g., f(x) = 2 Sin 3x)** into graphical representations and tables.

2. **Graphical Representation:** Visualize the converted equations as trigonometric graphs for better understanding.

3. **Table of Common Angles:** Generate a table displaying the values of the trigonometric functions at common angles.

4. **Multiple Functions:** Support for a variety of trigonometric functions, including sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent.

## Usage
1. **Input Equation:** Provide the trigonometric equation you want to convert. For example, **f(x) = 2 Sin 3x.**

2. **Choose Function:** Select the desired trigonometric function **(sin, cos, tan, cosec, sec, cotan).**

3. **Generate Graph:** Visualize the equation as a trigonometric graph.

4. **View Table:** Access a table displaying the values of the chosen function at common angles.
